# Event management assignment

Create a simple event management SPA using Angular 2+. Base requirements:
- Show the events in a list.
- Create a form to add events.

Nice to haves:
- Show the events in a calendar (use a 3rd party component) instead of a list.
- Reuse the form to update events.
- Use reactive forms and ngRx.

You can find the event interface and a bunch of example events in the models folder. Feel free to extend them if needed.
